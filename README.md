# ForeFlight Tips

The [ForeFight Users](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2036312003337297/) Facebook group has lots of great ForeFlight tips. I've started seeing some common themes and questions so through I would add a place to keep track of those.

## Flight Planning

* How do I add a fuel stop to a flight plan?
	* Add `STAY/0030` to the the flight plan which means a 30m stop. The format is `STAY/HHMM` where `HH` = hours and `MM` = minutes
	* ForeFligh Blog [Adding A Stop](https://support.foreflight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034183613-How-do-I-file-a-STAY-at-a-waypoint-within-my-flight-plan-in-Europe-?mobile_site=true&fbclid=IwAR0p6MjLbacYL6xXIqyhKbEzviUMON19Irgr8y6bqXF6hicteYiP3glnZpo)
	* This maybe a useful way to log cross country flights too so it shows up in ForeFlights reports.


## Weather
